# Formation-of-Confusion-Matrix-by-pymc3

We are given some data and from that we will create a confusion matrix.

Question is here:
• Case1: 70 TP and 50 FP are observed in 100 target and 100 noise 
trials. 
• Case2: 7 TP and 5 FP are observed in 10 target and 10 noise trials. 
• Case3: 10 TP and no FP in 10 target and 10 noise trials. 
• Estimate the discriminability, bias, TP rate, and FP rate of each case.

Discriminability
• Bias
• TP distribution
• FP distribution
= N(0, 0.5)
= N(0, 2)
= phi(D/2 – B)
= phi(–D/2 – B)
